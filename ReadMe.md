Challenge: Tic Tac Toe
Basic Requirements
Starting from a blank index.html and blank app.js file, build a single-page app for a simple Tic Tac Toe game, where:

the first move always starts with player X
the app detects a win or tie and displays an appropriate message
a button resets the game for a new round of gameplay
A single page app means that once the page loads, no user-generated actions on the page may cause the entire page to reload. One way this rule could be broken in your implementation is that you might consider resetting the game state by refreshing the page. This technique is not permitted for this exercise.

For the initial version of this game, you may only use native DOM methods to listen for events and update the DOM as gameplay progresses. This means: no jQuery, React or any other libraries or frameworks. All your code should live in one file, app.js, and all your HTML should live in index.html.

For basic requirements, no CSS styling is necessary. Use the browser's default styling for all elements on your page.

MVC frameworks help you separate and manage the concerns associated with user input, rendering to the screen and managing app state. Even though you are not using any frameworks, this concept can be applied even while writing plain-vanilla javascript code. Be sure to build your app so that each category of behavior is grouped in one area of your app.js file. Use coding best practices to ensure a clear separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces.

If you get stuck or are not sure how to proceed:

you may look at the hints file for this challenge to help you along.
you may substitute the use of native DOM methods with jQuery.
